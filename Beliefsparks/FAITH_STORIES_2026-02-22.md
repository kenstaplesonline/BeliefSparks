## Alignment with Tower of Babel Theme

These stories beautifully illustrate the Pentecost solution presented in the Tower of Babel article:
- **Unity through shared prayer** (Lord's Prayer broadcast)
- **Reconciliation between divided groups** (Fusion-UCCF, Elim-Assemblies of God)
- **Co-labouring instead of competition** (Radio networks, denominations)

All of these demonstrate God's unifying work overcoming human division—a living Pentecost in 2026.
