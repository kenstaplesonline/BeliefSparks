- Test landing page locally
- Begin building Supabase tables and schema

### Supabase Configuration
- Project name: theneighbourhoods-com (or similar)
- Tables to create:

  - `highlights` - Parks, landmarks, gathering places
  - `user_favorites` - User saved neighborhoods (Phase 2 feature)

### Google Gemini AI Integration
- API Key: Stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git for security)
- Model: gemini-1.5-flash (speed-focused)
- Backup model: gemini-1.5-pro (more capable, 2M context)
- Utility library: `@google/generative-ai`

- Use cases: neighborhood insights, content generation, Q&A
- Note: Logo generation via AI attempted, but model availability issues led to manual SVG creation

### Vercel Issues Encountered

## What Matters

### Ken's Priorities
1. **Quality Content:** Each neighborhood profile needs to be authentic, well-researched, and highlight positive aspects
2. **User Experience:** Easy navigation, quick loading, mobile-responsive
3. **Brand Consistency:** Maintain warm, celebratory, community-focused tone across all content
4. **Technical Excellence:** Fast loading, accessible, SEO-optimized
5. **Community Building:** Create genuine connection with Calgary communities

### Communication Preferences
- Brief by default
- Detailed when requested
- Proactive on issues (e.g., if something breaks, fix it)
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
- Update on progress regularly

---

## Open Questions

### For Ken
1. What's the launch timeline target? (alpha in 2-4 weeks?)
2. Should we add more neighborhoods to Phase 1 list before launch?
3. What's the monetization strategy (Phase 4)?
4. Any specific features you want to prioritize for alpha?

### For the Project
1. Should we use Google Maps API or Leaflet for the MVP? (Maps need API key budget consideration)
2. Do you want me to install shadcn/ui now and build full components?
3. Should I start building Supabase tables and schema?
4. Any specific neighborhoods you want to prioritize for initial content creation?
