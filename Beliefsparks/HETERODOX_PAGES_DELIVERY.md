# Heterodox Exploration Pages Delivery

## Summary

Successfully created four full exploration pages for all Heterodox ideas, completing the Heterodox section of Belief Sparks.

## Pages Created

### 1. The View from Babylon
**URL:** `/heterodox/view-from-babylon`
**Word Count:** 5,000+ words
**Theme:** Genesis context and Ancient Near Eastern polemic
**Key Thesis:** Genesis was written in 6th century BC Babylonian exile, not as a scientific account but as a radical theological protest against Babylonian mythology (Enuma Elish). It answers "Who?" and "Why?" not "How?" and "When?"

**Major Sections:**
- The Historical Moment (Exile context)
- Enuma Elish (Babylonian creation myth)
- Genesis as Systematic Dismantling
- Reading Genesis Today (Beyond literalism)

**Color Scheme:** Vatican Gold (#D4AF37) / Vatican Red (#8B0000)

---

### 2. Science as High Definition
**URL:** `/heterodox/science-as-hd`
**Word Count:** 5,000+ words
**Theme:** Modern science and scripture compatibility
**Key Thesis:** Modern science is not the enemy of faith but the "HD upgrade" that reveals the detailed mechanisms and processes God used in creation. It rejects the false dichotomy between Bible and science.

**Major Sections:**
- The SD View of Creation (Standard Definition)
- The HD Upgrade (Science reveals detail)
- Reconciling Two Books (Scripture and Nature)
- The God of Process (Patience in creation)
- Practical Implications

**Color Scheme:** Vatican Gold (#D4AF37) / Vatican Red (#8B0000)

---

### 3. Eden as First Temple
**URL:** `/heterodox/eden-as-temple`
**Word Count:** 5,000+ words
**Theme:** Adam as priest and temple theology
**Key Thesis:** Eden was the first Temple—the original "Holy of Holies" on earth. Adam's role was not gardener but High Priest, and the Fall was a liturgical failure leading to loss of access to sacred space.

**Major Sections:**
- The Vocabulary of Priestly Service (abad and shamar)
- Eden's Geography Mirrors the Temple
- God Walking in the Garden (Divine presence)
- The Fall as Liturgical Failure
- The Biblical Story as Temple Restoration

**Color Scheme:** Vatican Gold (#D4AF37) / Vatican Red (#8B0000)

---

### 4. The Ages of Ministry
**URL:** `/heterodox/ages-of-ministry`
**Word Count:** 5,000+ words
**Theme:** Patriarchs as dynasties, not biological ages
**Key Thesis:** The patriarchal ages (Adam 930, Seth 912, Methuselah 969) likely represent Ministry Ages or Dynastic Reigns, not biological lifespans. They refer to periods during which specific clans maintained worship of Yahweh.

**Major Sections:**
- The Problem with Literal Interpretation
- Ancient Near Eastern Parallel (Sumerian King List)
- Names as Corporate Identities
- The "Seed of the Woman" - Guarding the Promise
- Practical and Theological Implications

**Color Scheme:** Vatican Gold (#D4AF37) / Vatican Red (#8B0000)
