raw_text = """Judging Ourselves, Not Others                    John 8, verses 1 to 11                     While Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, they said to him, ?oTeacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say??? They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ?oLet anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.?? And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus straightened up and said to her, ?oWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you??? She said, ?oNo one, sir.?? And Jesus said, ?oNeither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.??                    Have you ever found yourself in a situation where it was easy to judge someone else? Maybe it was a comment you made about someone?Ts choices, or a thought you had when observing how another person was living their life. I?Tll be the first to admit, it?Ts easy to fall into that pattern. But in today?Ts passage, Jesus offers us a different way to see things?"a way that challenges us to turn that critical eye inward rather than outward.                Let?Ts look closely at John 8:1-11, a story where the Pharisees and religious leaders bring a woman caught in adultery before Jesus, expecting Him to judge her. Instead, what He does reveals a profound truth for all of us.                     &quot;At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, ?~Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say??T They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ?~Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.?T Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.                     At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, ?~Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you??T                     ?~No one, sir,?T she said.                     ?~Then neither do I condemn you,?T Jesus declared. ?~Go now and leave your life of sin.?T??                     Imagine for a moment what it must have been like to be that woman. She was caught in the act of sin, exposed, ashamed, and surrounded by a crowd ready to execute judgment. How often do we find ourselves ready to condemn someone when they are at their most vulnerable?                     Maybe it?Ts a family member who made a mistake, a co-worker who failed to meet expectations, or even someone we don?Tt know personally but feel justified in criticizing. It?Ts easier to look outward and point fingers. But Jesus?T response in this story turns the tables on judgment.                       1. We Are All Sinners.           When the Pharisees bring the woman to Jesus, they are ready to condemn her. But instead of joining in or simply dismissing their accusations, Jesus gives a simple, yet powerful response:             ?oLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her??           (John 8:7).                     How does that hit home for you? When I hear that, I immediately think about my own life. How many times have I failed? How many times have I fallen short? Jesus is reminding us that we all have our struggles and sins. Before we even think about judging someone else, we need to recognize our own brokenness.                       2. Grace Over Judgment.           After everyone leaves, Jesus does something amazing. He says to the woman,             ?oNeither do I condemn you. Go now and leave your life of sin??           (John 8:11).                     Jesus doesn?Tt excuse her sin, but He extends grace instead of condemnation. Isn?Tt that what we all long for? We want to be treated with kindness, understanding, and forgiveness when we mess up. Jesus shows us here that the way forward is not judgment, but grace. And if we?Tve received that grace from Him, shouldn?Tt we extend it to others?                       3. Self-Reflection Before Judgment.           Jesus?T challenge to the Pharisees isn?Tt just about them?"it?Ts about us too. His words,             ?oLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone,??           are an invitation to look within. Instead of focusing on someone else?Ts wrongs, we are called to examine our own hearts first.                     Think of it this way: before we point out someone else?Ts flaws, we need to ask, ?oAm I living in line with what God has called me to? Am I extending the same grace that I?Tve been given???                            In today?Ts world, how often do we see posts or comments online that tear people down? Maybe we?Tre guilty of making those comments ourselves. It?Ts so easy to hide behind a screen and judge someone?Ts choices, lifestyle, or appearance. But before we post that criticism, let?Ts remember Jesus?T words:             ?oLet anyone without sin throw the first stone.??                Would I want to be judged by that same standard?                          In our jobs, it?Ts common to point out when someone doesn?Tt meet expectations. Maybe a co-worker didn?Tt perform as we thought they should have, and we?Tre tempted to criticize. But Jesus?T lesson here is to focus on our own work and our own hearts before rushing to judgment. Instead of tearing someone down, how can we build them up?                     Sometimes the hardest place to show grace is in our own homes. We?Tre quick to criticize our spouse, children, or siblings when they don?Tt live up to our standards. But Jesus reminds us to extend grace, just as He extends grace to us. What if instead of pointing out their faults, we offered them understanding, support, and love?                 In conclusion,           Jesus?T response in John 8:1-11 teaches us a valuable lesson: we are not called to judge others, but to show them grace, just as He has shown us grace. As we go about our daily lives?"in our homes, workplaces, and even online?"let?Ts remember to first look within and reflect on our own hearts before we judge someone else. Jesus?T grace is for all of us, and we are called to extend that same grace to others.                      Closing Prayer:           Lord, we thank You for the grace You give us, even when we fall short. Help us to remember the lesson from Your Word today, that we are not called to judge others, but to extend the same grace and love that You have shown us. Give us humble hearts and the strength to reflect on our own lives rather than pointing fingers. In Jesus\' name, Amen."""
