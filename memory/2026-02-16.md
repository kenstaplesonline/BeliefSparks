## Universe Expansion Simulation Updates

### Camera Position Enhancement
- Set camera viewpoint to central coordinate (0, 0, 0) - the origin
- Updated info panel to explicitly state "Camera at (0, 0, 0) - the origin"
- Clarified that observer is positioned at coordinate origin throughout simulation

### 2-Minute Simulation Timer
- Added timer display showing elapsed time (format: M:SS / 2:00)
- Simulation auto-stops after exactly 2 minutes (120,000 milliseconds)
- Timer parameters: `simulationDuration = 120000`
- Timer displays current time elapsed out of 2:00
- Play/pause button changes to "Simulation Complete" when finished
- Timer resets when "Restart from Big Bang" is clicked
- Animation continues running even after reaching max age (13.8 billion years) to fill full 2-minute duration
- Added new info panel in bottom-right showing:
  - Duration: 2 minutes
  - Camera Position: (0, 0, 0)
  - "Auto-stops after time limit"

### Code Changes
- Modified `animate()` function to track `timeElapsed` from `simulationStartTime`
- Added `timerValue` display element in controls panel
- Updated button click handlers to properly reset/start timer
- Modified animation logic to continue rendering at max age until timer completes

### Earth-Centered Perspective
- Changed title to "Big Bang Simulation - View from Earth"
- Updated controls panel title to "🌍 View from Earth"
- Changed info panel to "Earth's Perspective"
- Updated observer indicator from "YOU ARE HERE" to "EARTH IS HERE"
- Added Earth glow effect around observer
- Added simulation info panel showing "Viewpoint: Earth"
- Updated CMB panel text to "Seen from Earth in all directions"
- Added title overlay with "View from Earth" message that fades on animation start

## Project Pause (2026-02-17)
- Universe Expansion Simulation project paused at user request
- Project status moved from Active to Paused in MEMORY.md
- All code changes preserved in universe-simulation/index.html
- Ready to resume when needed
