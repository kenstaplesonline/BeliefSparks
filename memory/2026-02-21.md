## Old MacLeod Trail Marker Posse - Frederick Staples Research Update

### Curio Assignment
- Assigned to continue genealogy research on Frederick Richard Staples (Ken's grandfather)
- Primary focus: Calgary Airport murals (reported occupation: artist)
- Created research skill at: skills/curio/SKILL.md

### Research Assessment Completed
**File:** old-macleod-trail-marker-posse/curio-assessment-2026-02-21.md

**Key Findings:**
- Calgary Airport new terminal opened: June 2, 1956 (lavish ceremony)
- Design: Ken Bond (Provincial Institute of Technology and Art student)
- Architectural firm: Clayton, Bond and Mogridge
- Cost: $1 million (1956 dollars)
- Status: "One of most modern air terminals in Canada"

**Critical Timeline Alignment:**
- Terminal construction: Early 1950s (design period)
- Terminal opening: June 2, 1956
- Frederick's death: February 10, 1957 (8 months after opening)
- **If Frederick painted murals, they would have been commissioned 1955-1956, unveiled June 1956**

**Glenbow Archives Reference:**
- Photo: NA-5093-671 (Calgary Airport, 1959)
- Location: Glenbow Western Research Centre, University of Calgary
- Address: 220 410 University Court NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4
- Contact: 1-403-210-6450 | asc@ucalgary.libanswers.com
- Hours: Mon-Fri, 10:00 AM - 4:30 PM

### Research Plan Created

**Priority 1: Glenbow Archives Visit (Immediate)**
- Search terms: "Frederick R. Staples", "Staples artist", "Calgary Airport 1956 murals"
- Key photo: NA-5093-671 (1959 - examine terminal interior)
- Collections: Photographs, aviation/airport records, public art files, newspaper archives
- Questions prepared for archivist (10 specific questions about 1956 terminal art)

**Priority 2: Calgary Public Library - Local History Room**
- Historical newspapers (June 1956 opening ceremony coverage)
- City directories (1948-1957 - verify "artist" occupation)
- Forest Lawn history files

**Priority 3: City of Calgary Archives**
- 1956 terminal construction documents
- Public art commission records (1950s)
- Airport authority minutes

**Priority 4: UK Birth Certificate (Long-Term)**
- GRO purchase: Q1 1898, Tottenham district
- Cost: ~£11 PDF download
- Information: Parents' names, father's occupation

### Success Criteria Defined

**Strong Evidence of Murals:**
- Photo of mural(s) with artist attribution to Frederick R. Staples
- Contract or payment record naming Frederick as artist
- Newspaper article describing murals by Frederick Staples
- Architectural specification listing Frederick's artwork

**Weak/Unverified Evidence (current status):**
- Family testimony only (no archival corroboration)

### Historical Significance

If murals confirmed, Frederick connects to:
- Old MacLeod Trail (via 1930 Fort Macleod marriage to Estella Carroll)
- Calgary's aviation history (via 1956 terminal art)
- Alberta public art legacy (mid-1950s municipal art practices)

**Timeline continuity:**
- 1883: Railway reaches Fort Macleod
- 1898: Frederick born in England (Victorian era)
- 1930: Frederick married in Fort Macleod (post-settlement Alberta)
- 1956: Frederick paints murals (if confirmed) at new Calgary Airport
- 1957: Frederick dies in Forest Lawn
- 2023: Old MacLeod Trail markers completed

**Research Status:** Ongoing - Physical archive access required
**Next Priority:** Glenbow Archives visit (terminal interior photos, 1956 opening records)
**Researcher:** Curio (Genealogy Research Assistant)
