## Session: Night Session (Ken heading to sleep)

### Vercel Deployment Success ✅

**Completed:**
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params issue in `src/app/neighborhoods/[name]/page.tsx`
  - Changed `params: { name: string }` to `params: Promise<{ name: string }>`
  - Made component async and awaited params
- Linked Vercel project to ken-staples-projects-e7a38146
- Deployed to production: https://neighbourhoods-two.vercel.app

**Build Stats:**
- All 11 pages generated successfully
- Static routes: Home (/), /neighborhoods, /_not-found
- SSG routes: 7 neighborhood profiles (kensington, mission-cliff-bungalow, sunnyside, deer-valley, queenston, bridgeland, altadore)
- First Load JS: 102 kB shared + route-specific chunks
- Build time: ~33s on Vercel

**Issues Encountered:**
- PowerShell execution policy blocked Vercel CLI → Used `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
- Vercel CLI initially required interactive input → Used `vercel link --yes` first
- Next.js 15 requires async params → Fixed component signature

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/neighborhoods/[name]/page.tsx` - Fixed async params
- `vercel.json` - Created (simplified, deprecated name property removed)
- Added `.vercel/` to .gitignore

### Next Steps for Tomorrow

Ken requested I work overnight on the project. Potential tasks:
1. Add more neighborhood profiles (Phase 1 goal: 10-15 neighborhoods)
2. Set up custom domain (theneighbourhoods.com) in Vercel
3. Set up Supabase database and tables
4. Improve landing page with more content
5. Test all deployed pages for any issues
