## Today's Research Activities

### 1. Architectural Firm Investigation ✓

**Key Finding: Clayton, Bond and Mogridge Archival Collection Exists**

The architectural firm that designed Calgary Airport's 1956 terminal has its own fonds (archival collection) at the University of Calgary Archives and Special Collections:

- **Collection Name:** Bond and Mogridge Architects fonds (formerly Clayton, Bond and Mogridge)
- **Repository:** University of Calgary Archives and Special Collections
- **Search Portal:** https://searcharchives.ucalgary.ca/
- **Significance:** This fonds includes project records for the Calgary Airport terminal (1956)

**Firm Background:**
- Ken Bond: Originally designed the terminal as a thesis project at Provincial Institute of Technology and Art in the 1950s
- Firm Formation: Clayton and Bond partnership formed in 1953, later joined by Allan Mogridge to become Clayton, Bond and Mogridge
- Major Projects:
  - Calgary Air Terminal - McCall Field (1956)
  - Bethany Extended Care Centre, Calgary
  - Prairie Bible Institute, Three Hills
  - Cave & Basin, Banff (1950s)
  - Jasper Park Pool, Jasper
  - Olympic Pool & Facilities, University of Calgary
  - Mire Katchen Residence (1954) - surviving mid-century modern example
  - Church of the Holy Nativity (Anglican)
  - Mountain View Bowling Alley, Glamorgan Shopping Centre

**Research Implications:**
The firm's archival fonds may contain:
- Terminal construction specifications
- Correspondence files
- Contract records (including potential art commissions)
- Drawings and blueprints
- Project documentation
- Photographs of completed terminal

**Critical Connection:**
Architectural firms in the 1950s often commissioned local artists for:
- Murals in public concourses
- Decorative artwork in lobbies
- Sculptural elements
- Specialized artistic features

The fonds may list artists commissioned for the airport terminal.

### 2. Public Art Context in 1950s Calgary ✓

**Research Findings:**

**Current Municipal Public Art Program:**
- The City of Calgary's current public art program uses a "1% for art" policy
- This is a standard practice across Canada
- However: No evidence found that this program existed in 1956

**Historical Context:**
- Municipal public art programs with formal "percent for art" policies emerged later (typically 1960s-1970s)
- In 1956, public art commissions would have been arranged through:
  - Direct architect engagement
  - Building owner contracts
  - Individual negotiations
  - Airport authority/city contracts
  - Private patronage

**Implications for Frederick's Potential Commission:**
- If Frederick painted murals in 1956, the commission likely came from:
  - Architectural firm (Clayton, Bond and Mogridge)
  - Airport authority or city
  - Terminal building owner
- Contract would likely be recorded in:
  - Architect's project files
  - Airport authority records
  - City building specifications (if municipal involvement)
  - Not in a formal municipal public art program (none existed yet)

### 3. Calgary Airport Terminal Context ✓

**From CBC Research (October 24, 2016 article):**

**Terminal History:**
- **McCall Field (1956-1977):** The terminal designed by Ken Bond
- Cost: $1 million (1956 dollars)
- Renamed after local WWI flying ace Fred McCall
- Opened 1956, operated until 1977 when replaced by new terminal
- Terminal was expanded five times during its 21-year operation

**Photographic Evidence:**

- Article references "overview of the terminal at McCall Field in Calgary, 1963" from City of Calgary Archives
- References "People wait at the outdoor viewing area at McCall Field" from Glenbow Museum

**Terminal Features (from earlier research):**
- Open public concourse
- Ticketing offices for three airlines
- Described as "one of most modern air terminals in Canada" when opened
- Lavish opening ceremony on June 2, 1956 with federal, provincial, and municipal dignitaries

## Research Context: Why Physical Archives Are Critical

### Online Research Limitations (Confirmed Today)

1. **Archival Collections Are Not Digitized**
   - Clayton, Bond and Mogridge fonds exists online only as a finding aid
   - Actual records (contracts, correspondence, specifications) must be viewed in person
   - Photo collections may have limited online previews
   - Newspaper archives from 1956 may be microfilm-only

2. **No Formal Public Art Program in 1956**
   - Current Calgary public art program is a later development
   - Art commissions in 1956 were ad-hoc arrangements
   - Documentation would be in architect's files, not in public art program records
   - Makes archival research more dependent on specific collections (not searchable databases)

3. **Terminal Demolished in 1977**
   - Physical structure no longer exists for inspection
   - Any murals would have been removed or destroyed during demolition
   - Only evidence remaining is in archival materials
   - Photos are critical for determining if murals existed

## New Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Architect's Records May Contain the Evidence

**Premise:** Architectural firms in the 1950s often included public art as part of building design. The architect's project file is the most likely location for documentation of any art commissions.

**Evidence Supporting Hypothesis:**
- Ken Bond designed the terminal as a thesis project (comprehensive design approach)
- Mid-century modern architecture often integrated artwork
- Architectural firm's fonds exists and includes the terminal project
- Architects typically coordinate all aspects of building completion

**Evidence to Find:**
- Terminal specifications listing artwork
- Correspondence with artists
- Contracts for mural installation
- Payment records to artists
- Drawings showing mural locations
- Photographs of completed terminal with artwork visible

---

### Hypothesis 2: Airport Authority Minutes May Mention Art Commission

**Premise:** Public building projects typically required approval by governing authority. Any significant art commission might have been discussed in meetings.

**Evidence Supporting Hypothesis:**
- Terminal was a $1 million public project
- Opening ceremony involved federal and provincial dignitaries
- Public art would have been a notable feature worthy of mention
- Minutes often record contract approvals and expenditures

**Evidence to Find:**
- Meeting minutes mentioning "art," "mural," or "decorative features"
- Approval of artist contracts
- Budget allocations for artwork
- Correspondence regarding commissioning of art

---

### Hypothesis 3: Photographs Provide Visual Evidence

**Premise:** If murals existed, they would be visible in photographs of the terminal interior taken between 1956 and 1977.

**Evidence Supporting Hypothesis:**
- Glenbow has airport photos from 1959 (NA-5093-671)
- CBC article references photos of McCall Field terminal
- Opening ceremony likely photographed
- Airport interiors commonly photographed for publicity

**Evidence to Find:**
- Photos showing murals in terminal interior
- Identification of murals in concourse, lobbies, or waiting areas
- Comparison of murals to Frederick's known style (if other works found)
- Dating of murals to match terminal opening period

**Summary for Kinesis:**

Today's research has significantly improved our preparation for the archives visit. I've identified that the Clayton, Bond and Mogridge architectural fonds is available at the University of Calgary Archives and Special Collections (same location as Glenbow materials), and this collection is likely to contain the most valuable evidence - the architect's project files for the 1956 airport terminal.

Key insights:
1. The architectural firm's fonds exists and includes the airport terminal project
2. No formal public art program existed in 1956, so art commissions would be documented in architect's files, not municipal art program records
3. The terminal was demolished in 1977, so photographs are critical for visual evidence

The visit strategy is now clearer: Focus first on the architect's project files (for contracts, specifications, correspondence), then examine photographs of the terminal interior, and finally search airport authority records. This is the most efficient path to either confirm the murals existed (with photographic and documentary evidence) or establish that no archival evidence supports the family tradition.
