## Research Findings

### 1. Online Records Located
✓ **FamilySearch.org:** Record found for Frederick Richard Staples (1898-1957)
  - URL: https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L8PJ-NFB/frederick-richard-staples-1898-1957
  - Note: Full details require direct access to FamilySearch (login required)

### 2. Birth Records
❌ **FreeBMD searches attempted** - No specific birth record found with:
  - Name: Frederick Richard Staples
  - Location: Tottenham, England
  - Date: March 24, 1898

**Possible issues:**
  - Date variance (UK records indexed by quarter, not exact date)
  - Location variance (Tottenham vs. Middlesex/Tottenham registration district)
  - Name spelling variations in records

### 3. Immigration Records
❌ **Immigration searches** - No passenger list or naturalization records located:
  - Keywords: "Frederick Staples", "Frederick R. Staples"
  - Period: 1910s-1930s (likely immigration window)

**Note:** Many early 20th century immigration records exist but may require:
  - Physical archive access (Library and Archives Canada)
  - Subscription database access (Ancestry.ca)
  - Specific search by ship/port of entry

### 4. Calgary Airport Murals
❌ **Online searches for murals** - No digital records found:
  - Search terms: "Frederick R. Staples", "Frederick Staples artist", "Calgary Airport murals 1940s 1950s"
  - Checked: Calgary Public Art collections, online airport history, public art databases

✓ **New Finding - Calgary Herald Article (August 1, 2024):**
  - Article: "From a grassy runway to a sleek new complex: Calgary's airports over the decades"
  - **Key reference:** Photo from 1959 of Calgary Airport by Glenbow Archives (Reference: NA-5093-671)
  - **Significance:** This 1959 photo may show terminal interior where Frederick's murals would have been located
  - **Action needed:** Request Glenbow Archives photo NA-5093-671 for terminal interior inspection
  - URL: https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/from-a-grassy-runway-to-a-sleek-new-complex-calgarys-airports-over-the-decades

**Historical Context:**
  - Calgary Airport new terminal constructed: 1956 (per Wikipedia)
  - Terminal opening: June 2, 1956 with lavish ceremony
  - Design originated in 1950s by Ken Bond, Provincial Institute of Technology and Art architecture student
  - Terminal likely commissioned public art/murals in mid-1950s
  - 1959 photo exists at Glenbow Archives (may document murals)
  - Old terminal demolished/replaced; murals may not exist or may be in storage

**Key Finding:** The 1956 terminal construction timeframe aligns with Frederick's active period (died 1957, Forest Lawn resident). If he painted murals there, they would have been among the first public artworks in the new terminal.

## Research Strategy: Why Online Searches Are Limited

### Primary Challenges
1. **Pre-1930 UK Birth Records**
   - FreeBMD provides index only; full certificates require purchase from GRO
   - Registration by quarter (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec)
   - Exact birth date (March 24) requires locating Q1 1898 registration

2. **Mid-20th Century Immigration**
   - Passenger lists searchable but often have name transcription errors
   - Naturalization records may not be digitized for 1920s-1930s
   - Border crossing records (Canada-US) may exist if he traveled

3. **Calgary Airport Murals**
   - Old terminal demolished; murals may be:
     - Destroyed during demolition
     - In museum storage (Glenbow, City of Calgary Archives)
     - Photographed in news coverage of terminal opening (1956)
   - Pre-digital era documentation likely exists only in:
     - Physical archives (Glenbow Museum, Calgary Public Library Local History)
     - Historical newspapers (Calgary Herald, Albertan)
     - City of Calgary Archives (airport development records)
