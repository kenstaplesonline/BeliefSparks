## Assessment of Existing Research

### What Has Been Done (Completed ✓)

1. **Genealogy Research (Estella Carroll line)**
   - Estella's vital information confirmed (1914-2007)
   - Marriage to Frederick Richard Staples (1930, Fort Macleod)
   - Three children identified: Donald, Ray, Shirley Ann

   - Death: February 10, 1957, Forest Lawn, Alberta (Age 58)
   - Marriage: 1930, Fort Macleod
   - Children: Donald (1948), Ray (~1935-1940), Shirley Ann (~1940s)
   - **Reported occupation: Artist - painted murals at Calgary Airport**

3. **Online Resource Searches Attempted**
   - FamilySearch.org: Record found (details require login)
   - FreeBMD: No birth record located (searched Q1 1898)
   - Immigration records: None found online
   - Calgary Airport murals: No online documentation found

4. **Critical Discovery: Calgary Airport Timeline**
   - New terminal constructed: 1956
   - Terminal opening: **June 2, 1956**
   - Design: Ken Bond (Provincial Institute of Technology and Art student)
   - Architectural firm: Clayton, Bond and Mogridge
   - Cost: $1 million (1956 dollars)
   - Status: "One of most modern air terminals in Canada"
   - Glenbow Archives photo: **NA-5093-671** (1959 photo of airport)
   - Source: Calgary Herald article (August 1, 2024)

### Timeline Alignment ✓

**Critical Finding: The timeline works perfectly for Frederick's potential involvement.**

| Event | Date | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Terminal construction begins | Early 1950s | Design work starts |
| Frederick active period | 1930-1957 | Living in Forest Lawn |
| Terminal opening | **June 2, 1956** | Lavish ceremony with dignitaries |
| Frederick's death | **February 10, 1957** | 8 months after opening |
| Glenbow photo | 1959 | NA-5093-671 |

**If Frederick painted murals, they would have been commissioned and installed during 1955-1956 construction period, unveiled at the June 2, 1956 opening ceremony.**

### 3. Architectural Firm Connection

**Clayton, Bond and Mogridge** (terminal architects)
- Ken Bond's firm designed the 1956 terminal
- **Potential research angle:** Architects often commission local artists for public art in their buildings
- **Research question:** Did this firm have a practice of commissioning murals?
- **Records to check:**
  - Firm's project records (if preserved)
  - Architect's papers/notes (donated to archives?)
  - Building specifications (may list art commissions)

---

## Research Strategy: Physical Archive Access Required

### Why Online Searches Are Limited

1. **Pre-Digital Era Documentation**
   - 1950s construction predates comprehensive digital databases
   - Art commissions were documented in:
     - Physical contract files
     - Newspaper archives (print, not digitized)
     - Architectural specifications
     - City council minutes
     - Airport authority records

2. **Murals Status Unknown**
   - Old terminal demolished/replaced (1977 new terminal)
   - Murals may be:
     - Destroyed during demolition
     - In storage (Glenbow, City Archives)
     - Photographed in news coverage (June 1956)
     - Donated to other institutions

3. **Privacy/Access Issues**
   - Personal records may not be digitized
   - Artist commissions may be listed under:
     - Architect's files (not by artist name)
     - Airport authority records (not searchable online)
     - City art program files (if program existed in 1950s)

**Assessment Compiled:** February 21, 2026
**Researcher:** Curio
**Status:** Ready for physical archive visits
**Next Priority:** Glenbow Archives (terminal interior photos, 1956 opening records)

---

**Note for Ken:** This assessment organizes all existing research and creates a clear path forward. The Glenbow Archives visit is the most critical next step - if photo NA-5093-671 shows murals in the terminal interior, we'll have photographic evidence. If the archives have records of the art commission, we'll know for certain whether your grandfather's work is documented.

Would you like Curio to:
1. Help prepare questions and search terms for the Glenbow visit?
2. Research other aspects of the family tree while you visit archives?
3. Continue online searches for related topics (architectural firm, 1950s public art)?
