## Family Narrative (Draft)

Estella Carroll was born November 11, 1914, likely in Claresholm or Lethbridge area of southern Alberta, to Benjamin "Ben" Reuben Carroll and Dinah Viola Vickery. As a young woman, she moved with her family to Medicine Hat by 1916, then to Claresholm by 1929.

In 1930, at approximately age 16, Estella married Frederick Richard Staples in Fort Macleod, Alberta—a significant settlement on the historic Macleod Trail. Frederick, born in 1896, would have been about 34 at their marriage.

The couple settled in the Forest Lawn area of Calgary, where their first confirmed son, Donald Staples, was born in 1948. Tragedy struck the young family in 1957 when Frederick died at age 60, leaving Estella widowed at 42.

By 1940, Estella appears to have moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where she is listed on voters lists as "Miss Stella Staples." This period (1940-1950s) likely saw significant family growth, with evidence suggesting at least two more children:
- **Ray Staples** - confirmed through 1940 Alberta voters lists, residing with Mrs. Ray Staples in Edmonton
- **Shirley Ann Staples Berge** - referenced in obituary records, indicating marriage to someone named Berge

Estella lived to be 93 years old, passing in Calgary in 2007. Her life spanned nearly the entire 20th century, from Alberta's early settlement era to modern day.

Her grandson Kenneth (son of Donald, born ~1953) continues this family legacy.

## Connection to Old Macleod Trail Marker Posse

While Estella and Frederick's lives postdated the historic Macleod Trail era (pre-1883 railway), their marriage location—Fort Macleod—places them directly within the geography that the Old Macleod Trail Marker Posse has worked to preserve.

**Timeline Alignment:**
- 1883: Railway reached Fort Macleod
- 1930: Estella & Frederick married in Fort Macleod
- 1957: Frederick died
- 2007: Estella died in Calgary

This family represents a continuation of southern Alberta settlement history, from the wagon trail era (Frederick's early life) through the railway era (their marriage) into modern Alberta (Estella's later life in Edmonton and Calgary).
