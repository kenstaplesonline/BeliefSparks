## 1. What Are Chinook Winds?

### Definition & Classification
- **Type:** Föhn wind (rain shadow wind)
- **Characteristics:** Warm, dry, gusty westerly winds
- **Origin:** Blow down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains
- **Pronunciation:** "shin-uk" in Alberta (interior) vs. "chin-uk" on Pacific Coast

### Etymology & Cultural Significance
- Named after the **Chinook people** who lived near the Columbia River
- Original coastal term, brought east by Métis fur traders and French-speaking Hudson's Bay Company employees
- **Blackfoot name:** "Snow Eater" (referencing its ability to melt snow rapidly)
- Coastal vs. Interior distinction: The term originated for wet coastal winds, but in Alberta refers to dry föhn winds

### Global Family of Similar Winds
- **Europe:** Foehn winds
- **Argentina:** Zonda
- **South Africa:** Berg
- **New Zealand:** Nor'west arch
- **USA (California):** Santa Ana winds

## 2. Scientific Mechanism: How Chinooks Form

### The Process
1. **Pacific Moisture Loading:** Moist air from the Pacific Ocean approaches the Rockies
2. **Orographic Lift:** Air is forced up the windward (western) slopes
3. **Precipitation Release:** Moisture condenses and falls as rain or snow on western slopes
4. **Dry Adiabatic Warming:** As air descends leeward (eastern) slopes, it warms at the dry adiabatic rate of **10°C per 1,000m**
5. **Result:** Warm, dry air reaches the prairies

### Temperature Differential
- **Moist adiabatic rate (ascent):** 5°C per 1,000m
- **Dry adiabatic rate (descent):** 10°C per 1,000m
- **Net warming effect:** Air becomes significantly warmer at lower elevations

### Dual Warming Mechanisms
1. **Air Mass Replacement:** Arctic air (~-24°C at Calgary elevation) replaced by maritime air (~-2°C)
2. **Latent Heat Release:** Heat used for vaporization on windward slopes returned during descent

## 3. Chinook Characteristics in Southern Alberta

### Geographic Distribution
- **Primary Belt:** Southern and central Alberta
- **Hotspots:** Pincher Creek, Crowsnest Pass, Lethbridge (30-35 Chinook days/year)
- **Calgary Position:** In the core Chinook belt
- **Northward Reach:** Can occur as far north as High Level, Alberta and Fort St. John, BC
- **Southward Reach:** Extends to Las Vegas, Nevada; occasionally Carlsbad, New Mexico

### Frequency & Seasonality
- **Winter:** Most distinctive and numerous (1 in 3 winter days in SW Alberta)
- **Frequency Gradient:** 1 in 5 winter days in NE Alberta
- **Year-round:** Occurs in all seasons but most impactful in winter

### Wind Speed & Duration

- **Gusts:** Up to 100 km/h (62.5 mph)
- **Duration:** Few hours to several days

## 4. Temperature Extremes: The "Calgary Weather Whiplash"

### Notable Temperature Changes

#### Extreme Records
- **Pincher Creek, Alberta (Jan 6, 1966):**
  - Temperature rose **25.5°C (45.9°F)** in ONE HOUR
  - From -23.2°C to +2.2°C (-9.8°F to 36.0°F)

- **Claresholm, Alberta (Feb 27-28, 1992):**
  - Recorded **24°C (75°F)** on Feb 27
  - **21°C (70°F)** on Feb 28
  - (For comparison: typical February highs are around -2°C)

#### Comparative Records (North America)
- **Loma, Montana (Jan 15, 1972):** 103°F (57°C) change in 24 hours (-48°C to +9°C)
- **Spearfish, South Dakota (Jan 22, 1943):** 49°F (27°C) increase in 2 minutes

### Typical Calgary Chinook Temperature Ranges
- **Pre-Chinook:** Often below -20°C
- **During Chinook:** 10-20°C (50-68°F)
- **Post-Chinook:** Rapid return to base temperatures
- **Maximum daily anomaly:** +13°C (northwest) to +25°C (southeast)

## 5. Visual Phenomena: The Chinook Arch

### What Is It?
- A distinctive **föhn cloud** formation
- Band of stationary stratus clouds
- Caused by air rippling over mountains (orographic lifting)

### Appearance
- Often mistaken for an approaching storm by the uninitiated
- **Rarely produces rain or snow**
- Creates stunning **sunrises and sunsets**

### Color Cycle
- **Morning:** Yellow, orange, red, pink shades
- **Midday:** Grey shades
- **Late Afternoon:** Pink/red colors
- **Before Sunset:** Orange/yellow hues

### Cultural Significance
- Iconic Calgary skyline backdrop
- Frequently photographed by residents and visitors
- Symbol of the city's unique weather identity

## 6. Environmental & Ecological Impacts

### Snow & Ice
- **"Snow Eater" Capability:** Can melt 30 cm (1 foot) of snow in **one day**
- **Mechanism:** Combination of sublimation and melt/evaporation in dry wind
- **Impact:** Rapid urban snow clearance without plowing; sudden ice melt creates runoff

### Soil & Vegetation
- **Soil Drying:** Desiccates soil rapidly
- **Vegetation Stress:** Plants can be brought out of dormancy prematurely
- **Erosion:** Contributes to wind-driven soil erosion

### Agriculture & Gardening Challenges
- **Dormancy Disruption:** Warm spells break dormancy; subsequent cold damages plants
- **Hardiness Reduction:** Even seemingly dormant plants become vulnerable
- **Species Limitation:** Plants that thrive in Winnipeg (consistent cold) struggle in Alberta Chinook belt
  - Examples: Basswood, some apple varieties, raspberries, juneberries, Amur maples
- **Tree Growth:** Native trees in Chinook-affected areas show reduced growth compared to non-Chinook areas

## 7. Impact on Calgarians: Daily Life

### Transportation Hazards
- **Blowing Snow:** Roads can vanish; snowdrifts exceed 1 meter
- **High Winds:** Empty semi-trailer trucks blown over on Highway 3 and other routes
- **Ice Formation:** Rapid thaw/refreeze creates black ice

### Infrastructure & Built Environment
- **Wind Damage:** High gusts damage structures, signage, and trees
- **Temperature Inversion Effects:**
  - Cold air trapped at street level
  - Warm air at skyscraper tops
  - Pollution trapped in cold air layer
  - Creates **inversion smog** during Chinook events

### Outdoor Activities & Lifestyle
- **Winter Recreation:** Ski conditions can degrade rapidly
- **Walking & Commuting:** Variable conditions—slush, ice, bare pavement within hours
- **Winter Clothing:** Often inadequate for sudden warmth; residents dress in layers
