## Viewing from Calgary

### Understanding Calgary's Night Sky
- **Latitude:** 51°N
- **Circumpolar Stars:** Constellations above 39°N declination never set below the horizon
- **Best Viewing Conditions:** Away from city lights, during new moon phases, and when the sky is clear
- **Light Pollution:** Calgary has significant light pollution. Consider traveling to darker sky sites for optimal viewing

### Finding Your Way Around the Sky
1. **Start with the Big Dipper** (part of Ursa Major) – the most recognizable asterism
2. **Locate Polaris** (the North Star) using the pointer stars of the Big Dipper
3. **Use Polaris** as your anchor – all other constellations rotate around it
4. **Learn the circumpolar constellations first** – they're always visible

### Best Dark Sky Sites Near Calgary

## Indigenous Constellations

The night sky has been a source of knowledge, guidance, and storytelling for Indigenous peoples of Alberta since time immemorial. These constellations and star stories reflect deep connections to the land, seasons, and traditional teachings.

---

### **Blackfoot / Siksika Constellations**

#### **Miohpoisiks (Pleiades / Seven Sisters)**
**Stars:** Same as Greco-Roman Pleiades cluster (M45)

**Story:**
In Blackfoot tradition, the Pleiades represent a group of seven brothers who were pursued by a grizzly bear. To escape, they were lifted into the sky where they became the cluster of stars. The grizzly bear was also placed in the sky as Ursa Major (Great Bear), forever pursuing but never catching the brothers.

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Seasonal marker** – Appearance of the Pleiades in the evening sky signaled certain seasonal activities
- **Teaching tool** – The story teaches cooperation, protection, and the relationship between humans and animals
- **Timekeeping** – Used to determine when to move camps and begin seasonal activities

**Viewing from Calgary:**
- Visible in winter evenings as a small fuzzy patch of stars
- Use Taurus as a guide – Pleiades are near Aldebaran
- Binoculars reveal dozens of stars in this young cluster

---

#### **The Big Dipper (Many Names)**
**Stars:** Same as Ursa Major Big Dipper asterism

**Story:**
The Big Dipper appears in many Blackfoot narratives. In one version, it represents a group of hunters or animals that help guide people. The movement of the Big Dipper around the North Star teaches about the cycles of time and the importance of being aware of one's surroundings.

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Navigation** – The Big Dipper points the way north (similar to western use)
- **Teaching** – Stories attached to the Dipper teach social values and relationships
- **Ceremonial timing** – Used to determine when certain ceremonies should be held

**Viewing from Calgary:**
- Always visible, circumpolar
- Most recognizable asterism in northern sky
- Use to find Polaris (North Star)

---

#### **Makoyoohsokoyi (The Wolf Trail / Milky Way)**
**Stars:** The Milky Way galaxy band

**Story:**
In Blackfoot tradition, the Milky Way is called **Makoyoohsokoyi** – the path that **Makoyiwa** (the wolves) came down to Earth. According to the story, wolves were among the first Earth beings to help humans. One winter, when the people were starving, a young man and his family were found by wolves who appeared as young men bringing fresh meat. The wolves taught the family how to cooperate with others when hunting buffalo and introduced them to other animals in their world.

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Guidance** – The Wolf Trail represents a path of guidance and teaching
- **Interdependence** – Story emphasizes relationships between humans and animals
- **Traditional knowledge** – Wolves taught which animals were appropriate to hunt (those with hooves and horns) and which to leave alone (those with paws and claws)

**Viewing from Calgary:**
- Best viewed in late summer and fall, away from city lights
- Visible as a faint band of light stretching across the sky
- Look for it arching from Scorpius/Sagittarius (south) through Cygnus (overhead) to Cassiopeia (north)

#### **Ipiso-waahsa / Morning Star (Venus)**
**Stars:** The planet Venus when visible as the morning star

**Story:**
According to Siksika tradition, two girls were sleeping outside their lodge when one wished to marry the morning star. Later, when gathering wood, a young man appeared and revealed he was the morning star (Ipiso-waahsa). He took the girl to his home with **Natosi** (Sun) and **Kokomi-kisomm** (Moon). She gave birth to a child and was allowed to travel anywhere in the sky except dig up a certain large turnip. Tempted, she dug it up and saw her family on Earth below. She began to cry. Morning Star lowered her back to Earth on a buffalo rawhide rope with her child, giving her a ceremonial headdress, elk tooth dress, and the **ookaan** ceremony. Her people were to use this ceremony annually to call on Natosi (the Sun) for help.

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Sacred ceremony** – Origin of the important ookaan sun ceremony
- **Relationships** – Teaches about connections between sky world and Earth

- **Annual ceremonies** – The ookaan ceremony calls upon Natosi for help
- **Medicine bundle traditions** – Star people gave medicine bundles to the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot people)

---

### **Cree / Ininiw Constellations**

#### **Ininiw Acakosuk (The Cree Stars)**

**Concept:**
In Cree tradition, constellations have multiple narratives attached to the same stars – unlike western astronomy where one constellation has one name and identity. The Cree approach recognizes that the stars carry multiple layers of meaning and stories.

**Language Note:**
- **Ininiw** – means "of the four," referring to the four energies (earth, air, water, fire)
- **Acakosuk** – means "stars" or "energies" (root "acak" means energy or light)
- **People are energy** – We come from the stars (acak) and return to being energy after our physical visit to Earth

---

#### **Mista Muskwa (The Big Bear)**
**Stars:** Includes stars of Ursa Major and surrounding region

**Story:**
One Cree narrative tells of Mista Muskwa, the big bear, who roamed traditional lands wreaking havoc. The animals of the land decided to send their best trackers and hunters, **Tepakoop Pinesisuk** (the Seven Birds, or Corona Borealis), to drive the bear from the land. During this pursuit, Mista Muskwa and Tepakoop Pinesisuk were so fast that they all flew into the northern night sky. The bear was placed in the sky as a reminder of how to treat those less powerful.

**Cultural Significance:**
- **Teaching** – Story teaches how to treat those with less power
